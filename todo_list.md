1. Dynamic error codes and messages with a struct variable. Normally, actual errors should be log into an external service such as Promethus, Graylog, Elasticsearch. In this app, I respond the actual error as JSON response to client and it's not best practice.

2. Validator package message can be override and I can type custom message accordingly.

3. Test cases doesn't suffice and they can be various and test more scenarios.

4. Records rows can provide a pagination feature for big data.

5. Add response samples, and error situations/cases in the README.md file for documentation.

6. Graceful shutdown might be pretty good for the web server in Go.
